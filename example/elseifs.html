	<h1>LuaFix2 - Example - <code>elseif</code>s</h1>
	<p><a href="../luafix2.html">Go back to Luafix2</a>
	</p>
	<hr>
<p>Consider the following code:
<div class=post>
local n = math.random()
if n > .25 and n &lt; .5 then
	print(n - .25)
	print("in middle")
elseif n >= .5 and n &lt; .75 then
	print(n + .25)
	print("in middle")
end
</div>
<p>The <code>print("in middle")</code> is the same in two places; if I wanted to
change it, I would have to change it in several places. If I was replacing it
with a loop, then I would have a loop twice.
<p>This means we should pull this code to after the <code>if</code> so that the
same one is used by both. A simple <code>if</code> has to be added to make it
<em>only</em> happen when one of the previous branches happened. It is easy to
do this in this case:
<div class=post>
local n = math.random()
if n > .25 and n &lt; .5 then
	print(n - .25)
elseif n >= .5 and n &lt; .75 then
	print(n + .25)
end
if n > .25 and n &lt; .75 then
	print("in middle")
end
</div>

<p>Let's say we're making a simple game and there are several materials: Stone,
Grass, Glass, and Dirt &mdash; there are no other materials. Thus the following
does not require an <code>else</code> clause.

<div class=post>
if material == "Stone" then
	getStone();
	wait(1)
	print("You got Stone")
elseif material == "Grass" then
	getGrass();
	wait(1)
	print("You got Grass")
elseif material == "Glass" then
	getGlass();
	wait(1)
	print("You got Glass")
elseif material == "Dirt" then
	getDirt();
	wait(1)
	print("You got Dirt")
end
</div>

<p>In this case, we know we are <em>always</em> going to get that message printed.
The last statement is a little different each time. Let's change it a little.
<p> The following does the same thing:

<div class=post>
if material == "Stone" then
	getStone()
	wait(1)
	print("You got " .. material) -- Stone
elseif material == "Grass" then
	getGrass()
	wait(1)
	print("You got " .. material) -- Grass
elseif material == "Glass" then
	getGlass()
	wait(1)
	print("You got " .. material) -- Glass
elseif material == "Dirt" then
	getDirt()
	wait(1)
	print("You got " .. material) -- Dirt
end
</div>

<p>Now each line ends with the same thing. We know that at least <em>one</em>
	will happen, so we can just move the
	<code>print("You got " .. material)</code> after the <code>if</code>:
<div class=post>
if material == "Stone" then
	getStone()
elseif material == "Grass" then
	getGrass()
elseif material == "Glass" then
	getGlass()
elseif material == "Dirt" then
	getDirt()
end

wait(1)
print("You got " .. material) -- Whatever
</div>

You could probably take this further and reduce the likely reuse between the
<code>getStone()</code>, <code>getGrass()</code>, etc.
